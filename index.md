Hello, I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan to graduate in 2028

##Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 4, Part 1

I really enjoyed this lab especially because of not only the introduction to makefiles and their significance but also the easing into how coding can be used in real life applications. In this lab, we utilized coding to do simple conversions that we all don't memorize and solve and that opened up my eyes into how amazing coding can be.

Lab 6, Part 2

This lab was a very complex lab but I enjoyed going through the process of coding it because not every project is going to be something that you know like the back of your hand since there are so many different variations to each project. With this lab, we coded the game blackjack with loops which made this project also a step into the game development.

Lab 7, Part 1

This lab I also felt starting dabbling with more complex pieces that play into how significant coding can be from making a game to creating something that can sustain businesses. WIth this lab, we utilized our knowledge wit vectors to redo our calendar project which ultimately told us how many days are between the set dates that the user inputs into our code.
